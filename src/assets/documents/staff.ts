Did you know Tango's time on Patreon pre-existed what we now call Titancraft? (There was even a Skype group! Technically, I'm still in it.) I'm a Utah native, which means I speak English with a neutral American accent with some Southern influence. I am on MDT (same time as Tango during the winter months). I am an old-school computer geek; a jack. (By this I mean I dabble in all things computer from IT to hardware to programming, and have "too many computers" according to some.) Professionally, I am a software developer.`,

I'm the primary author of most of the datapack magic used on Titancraft, so let me know via Discord if you have questions about how things work or think you've found a bug. My hours are irregular and always changing, but I'm often up late into the night. I speak English and can follow written French, but I'm too out of practice to keep up with it being spoken. I never pass up an opportunity to make a good pun, nor a really bad one.`,

I like spreadsheets, organization, programming (back-end only, none of this CSS nonsense!), knitting, and attempting to decorate natural landscapes in squares. I speak American English with a very strong Southern dialect, ya'll, and I am in the Central Time Zone (CST). Feel free to DM me in Discord whenever, though I'm normally awake on days ending in Y, most often between 10 AM and 11:59 PM.`,

I also have a small YouTube channel and stream on Twitch when I can. I'm from Central USA, born and raised in Tornado Alley. I speak English and I've been been told my amazing two finger typing is wrong... My life is hectic balancing work, life, and Minecraft, but I normally have my phone so feel free to DM me if you ever need something!`,

During seasons 4-6 I had to step down to focus on school, but I am back in full! I love this community and work hard to make it thrive. I am from West Coast America and can normally be found online during the evenings and weekends when I am not working. If you ever have any questions or just wanna say hi, by all means, please feel free to message me!`,

    name: "TPdenhaag",
    desc: `Seeing as the second part of my name is very Dutch and thus unpronounceable for inexperienced throats, you're probably better off calling me TP instead. I love reading, particularly mythology, writing, photography, building landscapes, and general stuff in Minecraft, though I'll never admit I'm any good at it. I speak Dutch fluently and English near-fluently, and I'll understand it if you speak French, German, or Latin with me, though you shouldn't expect a coherent answer back. I live in the Netherlands, which means I'm in the CEST time zone. I'm mostly conscious from 8:00-2:00, but you'll usually catch me online from 17:00-2:00 my time. You should always feel free to send me a message in-game or on Discord and hop into chat when you see me. I'm here to help (and have fun)!`,

I speak English as fluently as an American can and enough Spanish to find a bathroom. I’m usually available in the afternoons and evenings. In Minecraft I like to fairly evenly split my time between artistic building and technical projects. In my other spare time I enjoy sewing, costuming, crafting D&D terrain, painting miniatures, playing D&D, cooking, and medieval reenactment. By trade, I’m a digital artist focused on 3D modeling and texturing. If I don’t answer a message in game then feel free to contact me on Discord, I’m much more likely to notice it there.`,

At times when I don’t spend my free time on Minecraft, I like going on hikes, landscape photography, and cooking (or experimenting on) food… especially desserts. You can converse with me in English or German and if you really want to in French, though I may be out of practice. As a German my timezone is CEST and you’ll find me around at random times of the day between 8am and midnight. Always feel free to send me a message in-game and on Discord or ask me to join a voice chat if you need help or just want to talk.`,

Yes, I was a rocket engineer right out of college, but while in college I was paid to play with LEGOs. Now I just maintain the launch pad systems. I’m from the East Coast so have a New England accent to my English. I’m normally on in the evenings EDT and most weekends at some point. I’m into technical Minecraft, both farm mechanics and Redstone. Discord is the best way to contact me if you have questions on farms or mechanisms. I enjoy troubleshooting so don’t be afraid to message me and we can hop in a chat to diagnose a cranky contraption.`,

You can usually find me online early US evenings to sunrise (but that changes like the weather around here). Right out of High school I went and got an associate degree in Technology repair and IT then recently I decided to return to school to get a Bachelor's degree in 3D modeling and animation with a focus on environments. In my free time, I'm working on making a few games or tinkering with something creative. As part of the community I joined the server the first day it launched and not knowing what to do, I thought I would help the iron farm low and behold I found a group of people I liked and have been working on the iron farm for the server every season since.`,

I started to play Minecraft during the pandemic as Ingress, the game I played a lot at that time, unfortunately, came to almost a stop due to the quarantine rules. Besides being a staff member I'm also part of a group building crazy things and I love to help wherever I can from decorating, landscaping, tool repairing, and material gathering (as long as it's not snow. No more snow mining/crafting for me!) If I don't respond to your ingame message/whisper I'm most likely AFK somewhere and haven't seen that message. In that, or any other, case feel free to send me a private message on Discord and I try to respond as quick as possible. You can send those messages in English or Dutch. If you see me hanging around in a voice channel feel free to join. And when you have a question you wanna ask in voice chat but not with others around we can always hop to a private one.`,

I love to build big things in Minecraft - usually fantastical or made-up things, but also sometimes things inspired by real life - and I also love interior decorating and terraforming. I love creating useful things for others (such as Nether Hubs), and trying out new styles of building whenever I get the opportunity. I have a BFA from an art school, one of many questionable life decisions. I love storytelling in all its many forms; reading, writing, movies, TV shows, video games, art, and music. Minecraft is an art form that I love and am still learning how to get better at all the time. I live on the US West Coast, you'll usually find me on in the evenings, sometimes far too late into the night. I love to be helpful, please always feel free to reach out for questions and feedback!`,

I work in IT, and have degrees in Software Engineering and Cyber Security, though my work somehow does not directly focus on either of those things. <br/> I live on the East Coast of the US (EST), and I'm online typically after work until midnight or later.
