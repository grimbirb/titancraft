I am also the remaining OG Tango Patreon Mod. Did you know Tango's time on Patreon pre-existed what we now call Titancraft? (There was even a Skype group! Technically, I'm still in it.) I'm a Utah native, which means I speak English with a neutral American accent with some Southern influence. I am on MDT (same time as Tango during the winter months). I am an old-school computer geek; a jack. (By this I mean I dabble in all things computer from IT to hardware to programming, and have "too many computers" according to some.) Professionally, I am a software developer.`},{role:l.mod,name:"GrifterMage",desc:"Titancraft's official mad scientist. I live on the west coast of Canada, and occasionally need victims guinea pigs volunteers to help me forward the progress of SCIENCE! I'm the primary author of most of the datapack magic used on Titancraft, so let me know via Discord if you have questions about how things work or think you've found a bug. My hours are irregular and always changing, but I'm often up late into the night. I speak English and can follow written French, but I'm too out of practice to keep up with it being spoken. I never pass up an opportunity to make a good pun, nor a really bad one."},{role:l.mod,name:"FluorescentZebra",desc:"Should be PfluorescentZebra, but Minecraft has a dumb character limit. Oh well. I like spreadsheets, organization, programming (back-end only, none of this CSS nonsense!), knitting, and attempting to decorate natural landscapes in squares. I speak American English with a very strong Southern dialect, ya'll, and I am in the Central Time Zone (CST). Feel free to DM me in Discord whenever, though I'm normally awake on days ending in Y, most often between 10 AM and 11:59 PM."},{role:l.mod,name:"LiteHorizon",desc:"Known for my ability to compact Redstone to the limits, making adorable plushies, custom Minecraft models for some hermits, dabbling in making custom builds and terrain, and the best terror mini-game in the above! I also have a small YouTube channel and stream on Twitch when I can. I'm from Central USA, born and raised in Tornado Alley. I speak English and I've been been told my amazing two finger typing is wrong... My life is hectic balancing work, life, and Minecraft, but I normally have my phone so feel free to DM me if you ever need something!"},{role:l.mod,name:"DropDaBass",desc:"Hi I’m Drop. When I log on, everyone gets explosive cookies! I am one of the oldest mods behind Terk, being brought to moderatorship back in S2 of TitanCraft. During seasons 4-6 I had to step down to focus on school, but I am back in full! I love this community and work hard to make it thrive. I am from West Coast America and can normally be found online during the evenings and weekends when I am not working. If you ever have any questions or just wanna say hi, by all means, please feel free to message me!"},{role:l.mod,name:"TPdenhaag",desc:"Seeing as the second part of my name is very Dutch and thus unpronounceable for inexperienced throats, you're probably better off calling me TP instead. I love reading, particularly mythology, writing, photography, building landscapes, and general stuff in Minecraft, though I'll never admit I'm any good at it. I speak Dutch fluently and English near-fluently, and I'll understand it if you speak French, German, or Latin with me, though you shouldn't expect a coherent answer back. I live in the Netherlands, which means I'm in the CEST time zone. I'm mostly conscious from 8:00-2:00, but you'll usually catch me online from 17:00-2:00 my time. You should always feel free to send me a message in-game or on Discord and hop into chat when you see me. I'm here to help (and have fun)!"},{role:l.mod,name:"Aelflaed",desc:"My name is pronounced ALF-led, though I usually go by Alfy / AElfy / Ælfy. I live on the South-West side of the USA in the Pacific time zone. I speak English as fluently as an American can and enough Spanish to find a bathroom. I’m usually available in the afternoons and evenings. In Minecraft I like to fairly evenly split my time between artistic building and technical projects. In my other spare time I enjoy sewing, costuming, crafting D&D terrain, painting miniatures, playing D&D, cooking, and medieval reenactment. By trade, I’m a digital artist focused on 3D modeling and texturing. If I don’t answer a message in game then feel free to contact me on Discord, I’m much more likely to notice it there."},{role:l.mod,name:"Zalvy",desc:"In-game my passion is trying to make interior decoration work with stairs, trapdoors, and ridiculous amounts of flower pots. At times when I don’t spend my free time on Minecraft, I like going on hikes, landscape photography, and cooking (or experimenting on) food… especially desserts. You can converse with me in English or German and if you really want to in French, though I may be out of practice. As a German my timezone is CEST and you’ll find me around at random times of the day between 8am and midnight. Always feel free to send me a message in-game and on Discord or ask me to join a voice chat if you need help or just want to talk."},{role:l.staff,name:"ARocketEngineer",desc:"My wife introduced me to Minecraft when we were dating so being here is all her fault. Yes, I was a rocket engineer right out of college, but while in college I was paid to play with LEGOs. Now I just maintain the launch pad systems. I’m from the East Coast so have a New England accent to my English. I’m normally on in the evenings EDT and most weekends at some point. I’m into technical Minecraft, both farm mechanics and Redstone. Discord is the best way to contact me if you have questions on farms or mechanisms. I enjoy troubleshooting so don’t be afraid to message me and we can hop in a chat to diagnose a cranky contraption."},{role:l.staff,name:"Techd84",desc:"My In-game name is short for Technical Difficulty because I can fix most things but sometimes I make them worse. I am from North Central Texas and was born and raised most of my life here. You can usually find me online early US evenings to sunrise (but that changes like the weather around here). Right out of High school I went and got an associate degree in Technology repair and IT then recently I decided to return to school to get a Bachelor's degree in 3D modeling and animation with a focus on environments. In my free time, I'm working on making a few games or tinkering with something creative. As part of the community I joined the server the first day it launched and not knowing what to do, I thought I would help the iron farm low and behold I found a group of people I liked and have been working on the iron farm for the server every season since."},{role:l.staff,name:"Elaysah",desc:"I'm Dutchie living on the west coast of the Netherlands; CEST timezone. I started to play Minecraft during the pandemic as Ingress, the game I played a lot at that time, unfortunately, came to almost a stop due to the quarantine rules. Besides being a staff member I'm also part of a group building crazy things and I love to help wherever I can from decorating, landscaping, tool repairing, and material gathering (as long as it's not snow. No more snow mining/crafting for me!) If I don't respond to your ingame message/whisper I'm most likely AFK somewhere and haven't seen that message. In that, or any other, case feel free to send me a private message on Discord and I try to respond as quick as possible. You can send those messages in English or Dutch. If you see me hanging around in a voice channel feel free to join. And when you have a question you wanna ask in voice chat but not with others around we can always hop to a private one."},{role:l.staff,name:"FictionalXCI",desc:"My name is Fictional and I live inside my own imagination. I love to build big things in Minecraft - usually fantastical or made-up things, but also sometimes things inspired by real life - and I also love interior decorating and terraforming. I love creating useful things for others (such as Nether Hubs), and trying out new styles of building whenever I get the opportunity. I have a BFA from an art school, one of many questionable life decisions. I love storytelling in all its many forms; reading, writing, movies, TV shows, video games, art, and music. Minecraft is an art form that I love and am still learning how to get better at all the time. I live on the US West Coast, you'll usually find me on in the evenings, sometimes far too late into the night. I love to be helpful, please always feel free to reach out for questions and feedback!"},{role:l.staff,name:"Caableguy",desc:`You’ve probably already seen my face around on the server on one of the various statues of me around the map, or my appearances in the Above. I joined the server all the way back in season 1 and have been known for my beautiful bases ever since. I enjoy building bases, but also silly pranks or big farms, though I mostly have Nita to take care of that hehe. This is the age of Aquarius. I live in the Central time zone and am usually around in the afternoons and early evenings, feel free to send me a message if you see me!

When I'm not out mining terracotta, I'm usually playing with wardens or having fun with a silly prank on my friends, sometimes both! I love taking ideas from my imagination and bringing them to life within Minecraft. Outside of Minecraft, I love being out on the water kayaking or paddle boarding. I work in IT, and have degrees in Software Engineering and Cyber Security, though my work somehow does not directly focus on either of those things. <br/> I live on the East Coast of the US (EST), and I'm online typically after work until midnight or later. You'll find me in Voice Chat often, feel free to join if you see me there if you have any questions or just want to chat."},{role:l.staff,name:"Limbrogger",desc:"Hi, I'm Limbrogger but you can call me Lim. I started playing Minecraft in mid-2012 and never really stopped. I've tried most things in the game at least once or twice but my real passion is building and landscaping. In the real world I'm a residential architect and live on the east coast of the US; Feel free to come nerd out with me about art, design, or how amazing cats are.

          <h2 class="text font-bold text-2xl">What is Titancraft?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Titancraft is TangoTek's vanilla(ish) Patreon pay-to-play server, and available to anyone who is an active Patreon of $10 tier or higher.<br/>
            Since opening its doors to the community on June 5th, 2016 the server has been going strong over eight years and is currently in its <strong>tenth season</strong>!
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Titancraft is welcoming all players of all levels and skills. Whether you're into building, making redstone contraptions, making map arts, exploring, mining, designing minigames, destroying mountains of terracottas or even wreak havoc and shenanigans maker. There's a place for anyone on Titancraft, with people who spend an entire season making mega projects completely from scratch! Everyone is welcome to a community full of love.

            <h3 class="text font-bold text-xl">The Above</h3>
            <p class="text">
              <em>"The Above"</em> is Titancraft's unique custom dimension, filled with puzzles, races, games, quests, hidden loot and numerous bosses you can fight! It is a challenge for anyone who wants to experience a unique twist on an even harder difficulty. The Above is what inspired Tango to start the Titancraft server and has been upgraded through the years by a team of experienced datapack makers and builders for the community.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Conquering The Above can even yield you all kinds of special loot. Some loot will be boring Minecraft vanilla items and blocks, such as beacons, netherite, or an Unbreaking IV elytra. While some loot will be more unique with <strong>custom enchantments</strong> such as the Rush leggings, the Philia pickaxes and axes, or the forever-chased-after <span class="rainbow font-bold">Boom Stick</span>. All the items exist as fun rewards for your superterrestrial journeys, but they're completely optional; there are a lot of acivities to enjoy at The Above, even those who don't like to fight!

              Some holidays receive their own district where you may build in theme to your heart's content, and special activities such as pumpkin carving, christmas tree decoration and egg decorations!

                    <p>I'm an aspiring Fullstack Developer.</p>
                    <p>This website has been a side-project for me while I was on my Fullstack Development course as a means to learn, and improve on my skills.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>I work in TAC Technical Service Engineering at a large corporate company, I love playing games ever since I was a small kid, I love going out for runs, meddle with computers, paint and design things!</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>I've discovered Tango as my first Hermit when Season 4 of Hermitcraft launched, and since then I've been hooked! I've been an avid fan since then, and decided to join Titancraft and this incredible community at Season 9 of Titancraft, and launched together with Lomaxmom <em>(!lomax - for those of you who know)</em> the Freshers' Club!</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>You may see me around the Titancraft Server roughly around 4pm to 9pm UTC time, and during the weekends.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>I am part of the Badlands Brotherhood in Season 10 of Titancraft and usually hang around in a group, don't be afraid to say hello to me, I love interacting with this community and being part of it.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Needless to say my DMs are always open for a chat, and if you'd like to suggest anything for this website or any project in websites or minecraft, let me know!</p>
                    <p>Also, I stream on <a class='text-indigo-600 hover:underline' href='https://www.twitch.tv/grimbirb' target='_blank' referrerpolicy='no-referrer' rel='noopener'>Twitch</a> and have a Titancraft series on <a class='link' href='https://www.youtube.com/@grimbirb' target='_blank' referrerpolicy='no-referrer' rel='noopener'>YouTube</a>! :P (sorry Caable, stole your plug!)</p>
